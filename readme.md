# Big Theatre Project

This is my first project developed using **HTML**, **SASS**, **Gulp**, **gulp-sass**, **gulp-svg-sprite**, **gulp-webp**, **Swiper**, and **Bootstrap**. The project implements a variety of modern web development tools to build an efficient and visually appealing platform.

## Description

The **Big Theatre Project** is a simple HTML-based project for creating a functioning and responsive theater website. This project serves as a foundation for learning how to work with pre- and post-processors, image optimization, and modern frameworks in frontend development.
